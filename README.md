Macro Cheat Sheet:

⚡= PC token/sheet initial utilities.

💖= Increase selected token(s) HP.

🖤= Decrease selected token(s) HP.

👓= Generates a spellcard in the chat window with a list of command buttons. 
    Each button is a macro applying vision to selected tokens.

👓☀️= Token's vision applied as though the environment is bathed in daylight.

👓🌙= Token(s) is/are blinded. Most often used on NPC tokens. 
    Can help to reduce lag in game by having fewer tokens producing dynamic lighting.

    Bright lighting will automatically be added at 1/2 dim light radius. Lighting will be visible to all tokens the "have sight."

🏷️🎨= Tag token(s) with Condition(s).

🏷️🩸 = Tag token(s) as Bloodied.
